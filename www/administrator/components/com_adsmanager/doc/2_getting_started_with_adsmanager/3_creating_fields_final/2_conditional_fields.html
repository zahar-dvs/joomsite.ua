<h2>Conditional fields</h2>
<p>
    One powerful functionality with fields is the possibility to 
    make them conditional. This means only display a field if 
    another field has certain defined values. Combinations are 
    pretty infinite til you can mix fields with different types. 
    Below is a quick example :
</p>
<p>
    Your ad is in a category, let's say, "Automobile/Boats", 
    and assume that there will be different fields for automobiles 
    and boats. If you want to show certain relevant fields only 
    when in the boat category, you can do so using conditional 
    fields.
</p>
<p>
    Here an example of conditional fields.
</p>
<h3>Create the parent field</h3>
<p>
    The parent field doesn't need a special configuration.
</p>
<h3>Create the child field</h3>
<p>
    Once you've created the parent field, you need to create a 
    new field, this one will be set to be displayed only if a 
    specific value of the parent field is selected.
</p>
<p>
    Set 'Conditional Display' to Yes and specify which values 
    of the parent field will cause the current field to be 
    displayed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tips</strong> : You can associate any fields like 
    the two above and customize your ads form like you want.

    These fields are pretty easy to understand so we'll just 
    describe the content of the dropdown select here:
</p>
<p>
    Display Title:
</p>

<p>
    Column:
</p>

<p>
    If you don't know what columns are in AdsManager, see 
    <a href="">Creating columns</a>. 
    Otherwise you can assign which fields to display in the 
    column and their ordering.
</p>
<p>
    Position Display:

<p>
    Important: field names are <strong>case-sensitive</strong> so be 
    sure you exactly type the same name, you can copy/paste it.
</p>
<h2>Set a limit number of ads per user</h2>
<p>
    You can set a limit of ads per user for your category, 
    you just have to fill the field with the limited number 
    that you want.
</p>
<p>
    The -1 value is a unlimited number of ads.
</p>
<h2>Set an access right</h2>
<p>
    You can also limit the access of your categories to a chosen user groups.
</p>
<p>
    Two options are available, 'Read' will limit the read access of the 
    category to the users in the authorized groups, 'Write' will limit 
    the write access of the category to the users in the authorized groups.

<h2>Congratulations, you have just created a new category!</h2>
