<h2>Cascading fields</h2>
<p>
    Cascading fields are a special type of field available 
    with AdsManager Silver or Gold pack. This allows for the 
    content of fields to depend on another. For example: you 
    have two dropdown lists where users select a country and 
    then a city. With cascading, when the user selects a country 
    the list of available cities changes to match the selected 
    country.
</p>
<p>
    First, you need to select the cascade type field to display 
    its options.
</p>
<p>
    In the options of the field, you need to specify the name 
    of the parent field.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to use Ajax to load the data.<br />
    If you choose yes, the child dropbox field will be displayed 
    without a page reload, otherwise, the page will be reloaded.
</p>
<p>
    Then, you need to set the values of the field to cascade on, 
    you can fill these values the same way as you would for the 
    parent field.
</p>
<p>
    When users select a value of the parent field, all children 
    who cascade on that value will be displayed.
